# ConsistentSaberColors
PC port of im-henri's QonsistentSaberColors mod for Quest, allowing your menu pointers to be the same color as your sabers!

## Overview - What exactly does this mod do?
While the name doesn't make it inherently obvious, this mod allows for your menu pointers to be the same colors as your in-game sabers!

There is no config for this mod--it comes enabled by default and if you want to disable it, you will need to either uninstall the mod, or edit `Disabled Mods.json` in your UserData folder.

## Dependencies:
- BSIPA: v4.2.0+
- SiraUtil v2.5.7+

## Roadpath:
- Realtime color updates when editing color schemes
- Internal code cleanup
- Support for CustomMenuPointers (right now it's listed as an incompatibility, so this mod will be ignored if CMP is installed)

## Bugs? Feature Request? Suggestion?
You can either open an issue here on GitHub, or open your own pull request if you want to develop it yourself! You can also reach me on Discord, **Exomanz#8083**
